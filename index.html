  <h3>Action Plan</h3>

<p>In the year 2026 I would have completed all the necessary courses and equipped myself with all the necessary information and training to start my business. I would have worked on my website for 3 years and it will have reached the point at which it can be launched on google as an active website for my Pest Control Company. I would have saved enough money by 2026 to buy myself an additional vehicle with the sole purpose of being used as a work vehicle. I will then register my business and work through all other admin regarding the opening of my business which will then be opened in September of 2026, God-Willing. In the Past 4 years I would have learnt the ins and out of the pest control industry and equipped myself with the necessary knowledge that will allow me to stand on my own two feet. My biggest goal then will be to run and operate a successful business that will then entirely determine my standard of living moving forward. </p>
